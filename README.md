This project is a new optimization algorithm that I invent recently, which is gradient free similar with Golden Section Search.

This algorithm has been tested with univariate functions listed on web (http://infinity77.net/global_optimization/test_functions_1d.html#d-test-functions). Within this test function set, paramecium Algorithm overcame Golden Section Search with accurate rates 89% vs 72%.

The algorithm can be generalized into higher dimensions with line search algorithm or Parameciums in higher dimensions. The first kind generalization is straight forward and the second one needs more work, which is under going. 

ParameciumAlgorithm.py: This file have implemented the Paramecium Algorithm, Golden Section Search algorithm and test functions.
